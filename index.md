## What is this?
These are my realizations I had on my 30s. I didn't believe in them on my 20s. That is what makes them realizations. 

## The Current List

### Confident in these
- Things do not matter, your relationship with them do.
- If you can't do something quicker than its feedback, do it much slower. (Don't resonate)
- For kids, if it not play, it is irrelevant. Most of the cases, for adults too. Play.
- Your psychology will limit you sooner then your intelligence. 
- Most people think in first order dynamics/terms. Things that matter at least require the second order, too.

### These are useful to me, but YMMV
- Big emotions are big arrows pointing inaccurately. Reading them right is a superpower in life.
- It is useless to wonder whether one can parent. The 'now you' can't, but 'future you' will. Can a catterpillar fly? 
- If you are ordered to do something, it is not fun anymore. As it is not play, you will half-ass it.

### Hot Takes
- In most cases, people will emotionally decide on things, and then logically back it. You only hear the latter from them.
- Being rational is mostly an emotion.
